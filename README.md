# Chunk

Split an audio file into different chunks where silence is identified

## Setting up
* Install Python
* run `pip install pydub` - This is a python wrapper for ffmpeg
* setup `ffmpeg` - follow instructions from the official website [https://www.ffmpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org)

You can pass an additional `seconds_waiting` parameter. This is the minimum amount of time in seconds for a part of the audio to be classified as silence.
